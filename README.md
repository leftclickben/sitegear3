# Sitegear3

Simple website framework and decoupled web content management system, written entirely in javascript.

This project is very much a work in progress.  Please see also the original Sitegear written in PHP.

## Running Tests

First, install jasmine-node, from any path:

    npm install jasmine-node -g

Or, from the project root:

    npm install --dev

Then, run the tests, from the project root:

    jasmine-node tests/ --verbose

If you want less output and just want to see the final result, omit the `--verbose` argument.
